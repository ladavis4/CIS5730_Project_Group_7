Project Phase 2 Group 7 Write Up


Optional Tasks Attempted: 
   1. Task 2.7 Organization App delete Fund
   2. Task 2.8 Organization App logout/login
   
Changes Made For Tasks 
	1. Task 2.1:
	For this task a Map named idToName was added as an instance variable of the class DataManager and is used to cache the results of getting contributors’ names from their id in the getContributorName method of DataManager class.
	2. Task 2.2: 
		a) For the defensive programming aspect of this task, a number of if statements were added to check for null values and to throw the appropriate exception in all methods of DataManager.java. Additional catch blocks were also used to catch exceptions of particular types so that specific exceptions can be thrown which allowed us to pass the tests in DataManagerRobustnessTest.java. 
		b) For displaying appropriate messages to the user and allowing the user to continue using the organization app even in case an exception is thrown, we added try catch blocks in UserInterface.java wherever there is a reliance on DataManager and use the catch blocks to give the user feedback if there is an exception. The user can then retry the operation. We also added a try catch block in the main method in case the login fails initially when the login Id and password are given as command line arguments.
		c) After the defensive programming for this task, most of our tests from phase 1 were failing since they were not expecting the exceptions as specified in DataManagerRobustnessTest.java. To make our tests compliant with the newer implementation, we changed all DataManager test files to expect the same Exceptions as DataManagerRobustnessTest.java.
	3. Task 2.3: 
		The changes were made to the display fund method where after the basic information such as the fund name, target and description were displayed the user is prompted to provide an input of 0 to see donations at the individual level and an input of 1 to see donations at an aggregate level. The user is prompted again and again to provide an input till he/she provides an input of 0 or 1. If the user selects 0 then the donations are displayed in the old format as done in Phase 1, else, if the user provides an input of 1, the donations are shown at an aggregated level in descending order as mentioned in the specifications for input of 2. The results for the specification of phase 2 are cached as recommended in the specifications. 
	4. Task 2.7: 
		Created a new method deleteFund in the DataManager class. The method takes an id String argument and deletes the fund with the given ID by using the WebClient. This functionality is provided by modifying the UserInterface class’s displayFund method, in which we provide the option for deleting the fund that is currently being displayed. We also delete this fund from the organization’s list containing the funds. A test class containing various tests for deleteFund was also created, named DataManger_deleteFund_Test. 
	5. Task 2.8:
		Created a new method logout in the UserInterface class. The method is called from the start method in the UserInterface class when the user provides an input of -1 requesting logout from the user currently logged in. Upon the logout method being called the user is prompted to provide a login name. If the login name is blank then the user is re-prompted to provide a login. Similarly the user is prompted to provide a password and if the password is blank the user is re-prompted in the logout method to provide a password. Then the password and login is passed through the attemptLogin method of the DataManager class. If there is no exception thrown then the attemptLogin method returns an organization number. The organization instance variable in the UserInterface class is then updated using the organization number returned from the attemptLogin method for the DataManager and then we break out of the while loop in the logout method to return to the start method in the UserInterface class. If an exception is thrown then an error message is displayed and the user is prompted to re-enter the login and password information until the attemptLogin method succeeds.
